# My React Portfolio

Welcome to my **React Portfolio**! This project showcases my personal and professional work as a web developer. It's built using **React**, and its primary purpose is to present my projects, give a brief overview of my skills, and share a little bit about myself.

## Features

-   **About Me**: A dedicated section where you can learn more about my background, experience, and what drives me as a developer.
-   **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive and looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   **Downloadable CV**: There's an option to download my CV directly from the website.

## Technologies Used

-   **React**: The entire portfolio is built with React, allowing for a fast and dynamic user experience.
-   **CSS/Flexbox/Grid**: Custom styling using modern CSS techniques for layout and responsiveness.
